\page FutureWork Future Work

Many new ideas to come :
 - introduction of \e scene \e level \e effect : a way to use technique/pass for scene level management
 - introduction of intermediate resource management from within the effect : render-targets, texture-targets...
 - introduction of CUDA kernels : it will be possible to declare some CUDA code in a CUDAModule {...} section.
 - introduction of OPTIX code : same as CUDA but using OPTIXModule.
